A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>

    expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
    expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
    expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.

A sample loop is

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}

In this challenge, you will use a for loop to increment a variable through a range.

Input Format

You will be given two positive integers,
and (

), separated by a newline.

Output Format

For each integer
in the inclusive interval

:

    If 

, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for , "two" for
, and so on.
Else if
and it is an even number, then print "even".
Else if

    and it is an odd number, then print "odd".
